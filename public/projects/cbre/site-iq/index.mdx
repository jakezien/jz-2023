## What it is
<p class="bigText"> Site IQ gives commercial real estate teams a way to instantly generate the documents they need to communicate with their clients, and a collaborative, online space to manage data about properties in their markets.</p>

Our research revealed that each team had its own way of making their most critical documents, cobbling email, spreadsheets, and PowerPoint templates, and leaving a patchy trail of copypasted data. Without a single, reliable source of truth, teams had to manually verify the same data again and again for each new document. Site IQ replaced this inefficient, error-prone process with a friendly, modern workflow built to keep data fresh and reliable.

I was Design Lead on this project, collaborating with my Product, Tech, and Business counterparts to define the product from nothing, communicate with stakeholders, and guide a team of eight engineers to build it.
- Conducted research and interviews with broker teams and CBRE executives. We used the _Jobs to Be Done_ framework to determine the best problems to solve, then tested our solutions with them and iterated on the feedback.
- Communicated our vision and progress up, down, and sideways, and presented the product on stage at a conference of 600 brokers.
- Did all the design work: information architecture, workflow definition, feature flows, wireframes, prototypes, usability audits, and production UI; iterating and validating continuously with the team, users, and stakeholders.

### Defining the product

## The outcome
Site IQ launched to a handful of industrial brokerage teams across the US in 2019, and has added a few more teams each quarter since. Those who try it find it easy, useful and reliable enough for real business, and Site IQ-produced documents have landed in the hands of dozens of CBRE clients. Today, Site IQ is maintained overseas, but its design and its lessons formed the center of a new, companywide effort to create a platform for every team at CBRE.

## What went well
- We solved the problem we set out to solve for our users. They found enough immediate, durable value in Site IQ to rely on it for real, everyday business.
- We met the moment's business goal of helping teams be more efficient, but also correctly predicted and met the future business goal of empowering teams with data.
- When a reorg scythed our 60-person group down to 10 lucky individuals (including me), Site IQ was the only product among a dozen to survive. It became the foundation of a CEO-led, companywide effort to build a workflow platform for every team at CBRE.

## What I learned
- That an organization’s structure is a fundamental constraint on every project. It determines which strategies can succeed, and shapes any products or systems that result.
- The differences between classes of users, as well as customers, decisionmakers, and stakeholders, and how best to communicate the same information to each group.
- How to cultivate a lightweight, transparent design process that empowers engineers with context and is congruent with their workflow; and that design tools and workflows are evolving in the direction of git: collaborative, iterative, versioned.

## What I’d do differently next time
- Focus the work tightly on the most valuable thing — producing custom documents — and “outsource" the database stuff to an existing spreadsheet tool.
- Design our solution to be less self-contained and more workflow-agnostic.
- Approach the work not as product design, but service design: turn business stakeholders into teammates, and create new processes rather than new tools.
